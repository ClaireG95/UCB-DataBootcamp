Week 14 Challenge 
Claire Golden


        Overview


This week I was tasked with putting together a visual presentation for investors to pitch the viability of a bike share program in Des Moines, Iowa. I used data from a successful bike share program in New York City to determine if this program could prosper in the Des Moines area.




        Results


CitiBike data from New York City shows that males are more likely to rent bikes and have longer rental times as well.
  
  

Another conclusion to be drawn from this data is that the highest traffic of check in and check outs of bikes occur in the business district.   
  



I was also able to find that young adults (age 25-35) have the longest ride duration times compared to riders of other age groups.  




        Summary


Using these findings, the clear conclusion is that the target demographic for a successful bike share program is young men that live close to the business district and commute to work. When comparing census data between New York City and Des Moines. (https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/newyorkcitynewyork,desmoinescityiowa/PST045221), Des Moines has a higher percentage of males than NYC. The census data also shows that Des Moines has a much shorter average travel time to work. WIth all the gathered data showing Des Moines has a larger target demographic for this business, it is easy to see that Des Moines has the potential to be even more successful than NYC with a bike sharing program.
